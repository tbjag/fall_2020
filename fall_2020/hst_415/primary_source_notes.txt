Notes:
They didn’t really like that the scientists were forcing their hand especially that one senator.
The scientists made them think about the endgame policy.
What exactly building this bomb would achieve in terms of international policy. 
Outline:
Intro
Summary <- intro to events, introduction of chairman
Reason for meeting 
Hypo: the scientist’s general advisory report did not have a good reception but did have its intended effect. The GAC understood that total human annihilation was why this weapon should never be built. 
Main point 1:
How the senators received the letter pg30, 28
Analysis:
Did not like that the scientists put their own opinions in the feasibility study. –that’s clear. 
Discuss the later points that the scientists are civilians and are raising their point. Also that it is so important to them that they actually protested this. Quote people saying this makes sense. Also explain why the peeps are hesitant on taking advice. Point to the current political situation. 
Main Point 2:
Senators understanding the letter. 
Analysis:
Implications of the super in general. They acknowledge there is something wrong here with this many people getting killed.

Main Point 3:
They discuss implications and the end goal of building the super
Analysis:
The scientists plea works a little bit. Instead of just going ahead with the super, they are reviewing the advisory committee, and also putting an end goal with the super as a deterrent and international control as a bargaining chip-- 

Conclusion 
Review the events in the article
Recap  analysis and say that the scientists article did help them make decisions
